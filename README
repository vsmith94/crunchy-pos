# The Project
This project was created as part of the ITDS program. It entails creating an application that could potentially be used in the real world. The project specification are given by a real client. The team was composed of 5 people.

# The Client
It's a small store that focuses on selling geeky items such as comics, board games, and collectables. Due to the store being small it does not have any custom-tailored system that deals with the Point-of-Sale or Inventory management.

# The Solution
The solution for the client was devided in two systems that interact with eachother. The project is designed around the MVC architecture.
## POS
The first system takes care of creating and keeping track of transactions.
## Inventory
The second system is responsible for managing the inventory. Allows the user to perform CRUD operations with the items.
## Front-End
The front end is written in Java and JavaFX. The backend consists of a MySQL server that keeps track of the inventory and the transactions.
